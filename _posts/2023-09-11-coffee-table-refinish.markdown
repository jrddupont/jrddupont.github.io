I have an old solid wood (or so I thought) coffee table that has many cup stains and other wear on it. I sanded off the top and refinished with Rubio Monocoat but left the base as it was because sanding off all the little nooks and crannies would be a nightmare. It turns out all of the coffee table was solid wood except for the middle panel on the surface, presumably to prevent issues with seasonal expansion, but I accidentally sanded through a small area of the veneer. It's not big enough to worry about so I am not going to try to repair it. 

Tools Used:
 - Orbital Sander
