Recently, an [aperiodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling) monotile was [discovered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17743).   
Aperiodic means that you can arrange the set of tiles in a way where no transformation of the tiling is identical before and after.  
Monotile means that the set of tiles includes just one shape, no reflections allowed.  
  
I don't really know what significance this discovery holds, but the shape is interesting and I want to use it in future projects, perhaps a patio tiled using custom pavers.
