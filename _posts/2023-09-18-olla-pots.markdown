I have been interested in using [olla pots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olla#Use_in_irrigation) for some time so I decided to make these as a small test. I planted them with some creeping shrubs in my front lawn but the pots I used were very low quality and drain quite quickly. I am not sure where exactly is the best place to use them but I plan to experiment further. 

Tools Used:
 - Caulk Gun
