In my house I have an extension that we use for a dining room. It is quite tall and has hard wood floors so echos are a problem. I had originally planed to install actual acoustic panels but they are not the aesthetic for that room. Instead, I installed a large area rug on the floor and two large tapestries on the wall. This has helped quite a bit but the room is still not where I want it to be. The next acoustic treatment would be to install heavy insulation behind the tapestries, but before I do that I want to add paper lamps to the room, which might solve the remaining issues. 

Tools Used:
 - Drill
