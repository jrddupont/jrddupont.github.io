At our house, we have a lot of unframed artwork that we want to display. Usually it takes quite a bit of time to get them framed so I made these little shelf rails to display them.  
It turns out most prints are pretty curved and or floppy so they have a hard time staying on the rails. If I make more, I will probably make them stick out more from the wall.     

Tools Used:
 - Drill Press
