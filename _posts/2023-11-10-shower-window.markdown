Ever since we moved into our house, the window in the shower has had wood trim. The water and humidity from the shower was destroying the wood so I had to pull it out and replace it with something more suitable.

After I tore all the trim off I found a lot of rot in the wood behind the trim.

I scraped off anything I could and removed some wood strips.

Then I replaced the wood with concrete board strips

Then I filled in the gaps with tile mesh and thinset

To make sure water could never get into/behind the wall I coated the thinset with tile waterproofing membrane.

I debated for a long time how to attach the tile in a way that would be waterproof, what tile to use, what grout to use, and eventually gave up due to decision paralysis. So I hired a local professional to come in and do the final part for me.
