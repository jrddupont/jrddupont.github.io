The stairs leading up to the doors on my house were made by clowns; instead of standard stringers, they used untreated 2x4s nailed into 2x10 "stringers".  
The 2x4s rotted out and the nails rusted, so I replaced them with a premade pressure treated stringer and coated screws. I don't think this solution is to code, but it is quite a lot better than how I found it.  

Tools Used:
 - Crowbar
 - Miter Saw
 - Impact Driver
